1)I felt this exercise very difficult as there are a lot of problems in understnaing the question itself
2)Couldnot understand how to implement piezo as a sensor
3)could not implement pause
4)One suggestion is that please share a video of the demonstrationof the implementation of the exercise where you dont share the code 
instead just demonstrate how exactly the exercise code should work on the board.
