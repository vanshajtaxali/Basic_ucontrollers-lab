Colloquium:
Please come on 14.12.17, 12-13 to room 106-03-12. You do not need to bring
anything.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) 
--> Hints:
    --> To stop timer and save energy you should use TA0CTL = .. | MC_0;
    --> Dividing by 2 is better done with x>>1
--> No pause between molodies
    --> You don't stop PWM signal.
	    --> Use TA0CTL = .. | MC_0; after a melody is played to stop timer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b)
--> Interrupt for PB5 not disabled while playing (-0.5 pt.)
    --> Disable: P1IE &= ~BIT3;
	--> Enable:P1IE |= BIT3; 
	
--> Melodies are played infinitely (-0.5 pt.)
    --> After PB5 is pressed once or twice within 1 second, a molody should
	    played once.
	--> To stop PWM signal use TA0CTL = .. | MC_0;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c) & d) not implemented (-3 pts) 
--> To use the buzzer as a sensor:
    --> Reconfigure pin 3.6 as GPIO input with pull-up or pull-down restistor
	--> Read P3IN out with polling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feedback:
--> I will show you a sample solution at the colloquium.
