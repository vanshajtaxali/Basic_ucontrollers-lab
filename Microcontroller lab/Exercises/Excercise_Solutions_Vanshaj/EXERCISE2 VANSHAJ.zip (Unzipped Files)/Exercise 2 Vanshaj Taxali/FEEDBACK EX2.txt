General Feedback
Exercise was basic and again yet very tricky at some points I really have to work on some logics although some questions were unclear
I did them according to my understanding but made the code such that it can also work other way around if required
just some commenting and uncommenting is required.

SPECIFIC FEEDBACK
Q 1d) it was unclear that if we need to turn on or off the green and red led while we turn on the blue one so I turned it off
Q 1f) I turned the red led on directly by function Red_led(); which is in comments due to interrupts weather to uncomment while interrupt 
was ok or not?? anyhow it wont work with the interrupt any way
Q 1g) it was not clear as to what exactly should interrupt function do so we read the PB5 with polling PB6 in the if condition and thus defining
the function in such a way that it behaves like the Red_led(); function.
