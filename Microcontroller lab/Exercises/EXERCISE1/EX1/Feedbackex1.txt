1) Trying to find a more efficient program to blink multilple LED's at the same time with different frequency.
2) couldnot fully understand part 3 of task1. Although tried to complete it to best of my knowledge but doesnt know 
how to know current state on a output pin.
3)the exercise is good it seems basic but its not that easy as it seems.

 cannot upload any code in my controller even if it is build correctly and 
unable to reset the microcontroller externally so need help on that part.
